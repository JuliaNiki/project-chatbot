# Project Name

This project was made on forth week for Technigo bootcamp as pair programming project 
(Mamite Andersson & me). 
The project's aim was to practice some parts of JavaScript we've learnt so far by creating a chat bot! We got more familiar with variables, conditionals statements, event listeners and understanding the flow.

## The problem

We found this project pretty challenging for the first week with fully dive in into Javascript. We got an inspiration from Technigo's example of Pizza bot, knowledge from weekly materials that we got from school and some help from live sessions. 
Pair programming was a good idea for this type of project. We learned a lot by doing it and even if it may seem like we simplified the code for us to understand, the bot works and lets the user to interact with it.
